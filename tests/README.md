# Functional tests

This directory contains examples of functional tests:

- `ledgercomm/` directory uses the
  [Python LedgerComm library](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgercomm), which
  allows the tests to run either on an actual Nano, or on
  [Speculos](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos),
- `speculos/` directory uses the Python client of
  [Speculos](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos) to run the tests directly on
  the Speculos emulator
